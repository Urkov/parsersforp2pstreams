Instructions for downloading all parsers.

If you want to get all the parsers at once:
1) go to the addon settings
2) Section lists/parsers
3) Execute remote python script
4) Introduce this url: http://bit.ly/allparsers
5) click ok and wait

If you only want to install certain parsers:  I will provide a direct link url but it is easier to install all parsers and just remove the ones you don`t want to keep.
